Description:
============

dcow is a possible exploit of the vulnerability CVE-2016-5195.
Running the program as unprivileged user on a vulnerable system, it'll modify the /etc/passwd file, forcing the password "dirtyCowFun" (SHA-512, but could be modified for older standards).
In case of successful execution, doing a "su" with that password, a root shell will be available.
Using the -s option, a root shell will be automatically opened.
A backup of the original /etc/passwd will be created in the current directory as .ssh_bak.
